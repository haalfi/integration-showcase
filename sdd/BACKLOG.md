# Development Backlog

Active work items. Completed items live in [BACKLOG-DONE.md](BACKLOG-DONE.md).

Items graduate: **Idea -> Backlog -> Spec -> Tests -> Code**.

## How this file works

**Status legend:** `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in progress

**Ordering:**
- *Backlog (Prioritized)* is execution-ordered: concept-first, then small wins,
  then substantive code work, then cleanup. Insert new items at the position
  that matches their priority, not at the top.
- *Ideas* is newest-first; new ideas go to the top.

**Completing work:**
- Fully done -> delete from here, add to `BACKLOG-DONE.md` as `[x]` (same commit as code change).
- Partially done -> split: ship done part to `BACKLOG-DONE.md` under original ID, create new ID here
  for remainder, link both.

**ID prefixes:**

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `BL-NNN` | Release blocker. |
| `BK-NNN` | Committed backlog work, queued behind blockers. |
| `BUG-NNN` | Confirmed defect with reproduction steps. |
| `IS-NNN` | Showcase item. |

## Backlog (Prioritized)

Ordered by recommended execution: concept-first (sets the acceptance bar),
then small-wins, then the substantive code work, then cleanup.

## Ideas

- **IS-ext-metrics** -- One counter `saga_completed_total{outcome}` and one histogram
  `saga_duration_seconds`. Validates concept §6 cardinality rule (business_tx_id stays out
  of metric labels) with a real example. Pull when the demo story benefits from a metrics
  pane alongside traces.

- **IS-ext-otlp-logs** -- Replace the stdout JSON log handler with an OTLP log exporter;
  wire collector -> log backend. Today JSON logs land only in Docker logs; an OTLP pipeline
  would correlate logs with traces inside the same backend.

- **BK-ext-collector** -- Wire `otel-collector-config.yaml` between services and Jaeger;
  flip `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` default from `jaeger:4317` to `otel-collector:4317`.
  Gives real batching / sampling / routing infrastructure instead of direct-to-Jaeger.
